# Ubisoft-DNA Full-Stack technical test

For this project, you will be fetching and displaying data from the Twitch API. You can find the documentation for the Twitch API [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/)

**Please note that in order to access the Twitch API, you'll have to create a Twitch account.** More on this below.

## Objective

Your goal will be to build a simple web dashboard with the following 2 features:

1. You will need to create a Web Socket connection to display the number of viewers for Rainbow Six Siege that automatically updates a counter in real time (keep in mind the request throttling limit of the Twitch API).
2. We would like a line Chart that compares in real time the number of viewers for the following 3 games:
    - Rainbow Six Siege
https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Tom%20Clancy's%20Rainbow%20Six%3A%20Siege
    - Far Cry 5
https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Far%20Cry%205
    - Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey
https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Assassin's%20Creed%20Odyssey

## Technologies

Front-end: **Ideally Angular/RxJS/Typescript to match the DNA stack** 
Back-end: **your choice**

## Signing up for Twitch

- Sign up for a Twitch account.
- Enable 2-factor authentication on your Twitch account.
- Go to the [Twitch Developer site](https://dev.twitch.tv/) to create a new App.
- Get your Client-ID and Client Secret by clicking on Manage App. You will need these to authenticate with the Twitch API.

### Authenticating with Twitch API

To get your Twitch API `access_token`, you will need to use:
`GET https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token?client_id=[YOUR-CLIENT-ID]&client_secret=[YOUR-SECRET]&grant_type=client_credentials`

### Twitch API Examples

To get the data for one game, you can use:
`GET https://api.twitch.tv/helix/games?name=Rainbow Six Siege`

To get a list of top games:
`GET https://api.twitch.tv/helix/games/top`

To get Streams for a game (which contains a viewer_count):
`GET https://api.twitch.tv/helix/streams?game_id=493057`

To get more Streams for a game:
`GET https://api.twitch.tv/helix/streams?after=[PAGINATION_CURSOR]`

The `after` value is the cursor that is returned from the first Streams endpoint. The cursor allows for forward pagination. Consult the [Get Streams](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#get-streams) reference to learn more about the query parameters.

For the requests above, you will need to pass the following headers: 
- Client-ID: [YOUR-CLIENT-ID]
- Authorization: Bearer [YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN]

Consult the [Twitch API Reference](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference) to learn more.

## Rules 

The project should not take more than 1 week.
To submit your project, please push the code in this repository (You'll have access to this repository for a week). 
Also, please have the project hosted online using a service such as Heroku and provide us with the link. 
You are encouraged to submit all of your work at the end of the 1 week period even if it is not complete.
 
- document your API design (routes + payload)
- document your code only if needed
- document the steps required to run your project or to run tests
- use Markdown to share your documentation inside this code repository

Good luck, be creative and have fun :)


###Resolution

###Server

The node server is so far ready to deploy locally on port 3000, with the command line "node server.js"
The route that are accessible are :
 - /server_api/token
 - /server_api/top_games
 - /server_api/game/:game_name
 - /server_api/gameStreams/:game_id
 - /server_api/gameStreams/after/:pagination
